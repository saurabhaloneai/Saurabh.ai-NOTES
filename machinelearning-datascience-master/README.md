## **Section 2: Machine Learning 101**

### What Is Machine Learning?

- Machines can perform tasks really fast
- We give them instructions to do tasks and they do it for us
- Computers used to mean people who do tasks that compute
- Problem: How to get to Danielle's house using Google maps?
- Imagine we had ten different routes to Danielle's house
  - Option 1: I measure each route one by one
  - Option 2: I program and tell the computer to calculate these 10 routes and find the shortest one.
- Problem: Somebody left a review on Amazon. Is this person angry?
- How can I describe to a computer what angry means?
- We let machines take care of the easier part of which things we can describe
- Things that are hard to just give instructions to, we let human do it
- The goal of machine learning is to make machines act more and more like humans because the smarter they

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Types of Machine Learning Problems

- When shouldn't you use machine learning?
  - When a simple hand-coded instruction based system will work
- Main types of machine learning
  - Supervised Learning
  - Unsupervised Learning
  - Transfer Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning
- Supervised Learning: data and label -> make prediction
  - Classification: Is this example one thing or another?
    - Binary classification = two options
    - Example: heart disease or no heart disease?
    - Multi-class classification = more than two options
  - Regression: Predict a number
    - Example: How much will this house sell for?
    - Example: How many people will buy this app?
- Unsupervised Learning: has data but no labels
  - Existing Data: Purchase history of all customers
  - Scenario: Marketing team want to send out promotion for next summer
  - Question: Do you know who is interested in summer clothes?
  - Process: Apply labels such as Summer or Winter to data
  - Solution: Cluster 1 (Summer) and Cluster 2 (Winter)
- Transfer Learning: leverages what one machine learning model has learned in another machine learning model
  - Example: Predict what dog breed appears in a photo
  - Solution: Find an existing model which is learned to decipher different car types and fine tune it for your task
- Reinforcement Learning: a computer program perform some actions within a defined space and rewarding it for doing it well or punishing it for doing poorly
  - Example: teach a machine learning algorithm to play chess
- Matching your problem
  - Supervised Learning: I know my inputs and outputs
  - Unsupervised Learning: I am not sure of the outputs but I have inputs
  - Transfer Learning: I think my problem may be similar to something else

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Types of Data: What kind of data do we have?

- Different types of data
  - Structured data: all of the samples have similar format
  - Unstructured data: images and natural language text such as phone calls, videos and audio files
  - Static: doesn't change over time, example: csv
    - More data -> Find patterns -> Predict something in the future
  - Streaming: data which is constantly changed over time
    - Example: predict how a stock price will change based on news headlines
    - News headlines are being updated constantly you'll want to see how they change stocks
- Start on static data and then if your data analysis and machine learning efforts prove to show some insights you'll move towards streaming data when you go to deployment or in production
- A data science workflow
  - open csv file in jupyter notebook (a tool to build machine learning project)
  - perform data analysis with panda (a python library for data analysis)
  - make visualizations such as graphs and comparing different data points with Matplotlib
  - build machine learning model on the data using scikit learn to predict using these patterns

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Types of Evaluation: What defines success for us?

- Example: if your problem is to use patient medical records to classify whether someone has heart disease or not you might start by saying for this project to be valuable we need a machine learning model with over 99% accuracy
- data -> machine learning model -> predict: heart disease? -> accurancy 97.8%
- predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease is an important task so you want a highly accurate model
- Different types of metrics for different problems
  - Classification: accurancy, percision, recall
  - Regression: Mean absolute error (MAE), Mean squared error (MSE), Root mean squared error (RMSE)
  - Recommendation: Precision at K
- Example: Classifying car insurance claims
  - text from car insurance claims -> machine learning model -> predict who caused the accident (person submitting the claim or the other person involved ?) -> min 95% accuracy who caused the accident (allow to get it wrong 1 out of 20 claims)

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Features In Data: What do we already know about the data?

- Features is another word for different forms of data
- Features refers to the different forms of data within structured or unstructured data
- For example: predict heart disease problem
  - Features of the data: weight, sex, heart rate
  - They can also be referred to as feature variables
  - We use the feature variables to predict the target variable which is whether a person has heart disease or no.
- Different features of data
  - numerical features: a number like body weight
  - categorical features: sex or whether a patient is a smoker or not
  - derived features: looks at different features of data and creates a new feature / alter existing feature
    - Example: look at someone's hospital visit history timestamps and if they've had a visit in the last year you could make a categorical feature called visited in last year. If someone had visited in the last year they would get true.
    - feature engineering: process of deriving features like this out of data
- Unstructured data has features too
  - a little less obvious if you looked at enough images of dogs you'd start to figure out
  - legs: most of these creatures have four shapes coming out of their body
  - eyes: a couple of circles up the front
  - machine learning algorithm figure out what features are there on its own
- What features should you use?
  - a machine learning algorithm learns best when all samples have similar information
  - feature coverage: process of ensuring all samples have similar information

### Modelling Part 1 - 3 sets

- Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
- 3 parts to modelling
  - Choosing and training a model
  - Tuning a model
  - Model comparison
- The most important concept in machine learning (the training, validation and test sets or 3 sets)
  - Your data is split into 3 sets
    - training set: train your model on this
    - validation set: tune your model on this
    - test set: test and compare on this
  - at university
    - training set: study course materials
    - validation set: practice exam
    - test set: final exam
  - generalisation: the ability for a machine learning model to perform well on data it has not seen before
- When things go wrong
  - Your professor accidentally sent out the final exam for everyone to practice on
  - when it came time to the actual exam, everyone would have already seen it now
  - Since people know what they should be expecting they go through the exam
  - They answer all the questions with ease and everyone ends up getting top marks
  - Now top marks might appear good but did the students really learn anything or were they just expert memorization machines
  - for your machine learning models to be valuable at predicting something in the future on unseen data you'll want to avoid them becoming memorization machines
- split 100 patient records
  - training split: 70 patient records (70-80%)
  - validation split: 15 patient records (10-15%)
  - test split: 15 patient records (10-15%)

### Modelling Part 2 - Choosing

- Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
- 3 parts to modelling
  - Choosing and training a model: training data
  - Tuning a model: validation data
  - Model comparison: test data
- Choosing a model
  - Problem 1 -> model 1
  - Problem 2 -> model 2
  - Structured Data: [CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/), [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost), [Random Forest](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-random-forest-58381e0602d2)
  - Unstructured Data: Deep Learning, Transfer Learning
- Training a model
  - inputs: X(data) -> model -> predict outputs: y(label)
  - Goal: minimise time between experiments
    - Experiment 1: inputs -> model 1 -> outputs -> accurancy (87.5%) -> training time (3 min)
    - Experiment 2: inputs -> model 2 -> outputs -> accurancy (91.3%) -> training time (92 min)
    - Experiment 3: inputs -> model 3 -> outputs -> accurancy (94.7%) -> training time (176 min)
  - Things to remember
    - Some models work better than others and different problems
    - Don't be afraid to try things
    - Start small and build up (add complexity) as you need.

### Modelling Part 3 - Tuning

- Based on our problem and data, what model should we use?
- Example: Random Forest - adjust number of trees: 3, 5
- Example: Neural Networks - adjust number of layers: 2, 3
- Things to remember
  - Machine learning models have hyper parameters you can adjust
  - A model first results are not it's last
  - Tuning can take place on training or validation data sets

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Modelling Part 4 - Comparison

- How will our model perform in the real world?
- Testing a model
  - Data Set: Training -> Test
  - Performance: 98% -> 96%
- Underfitting (potential)
  - Data Set: Training -> Test
  - Performance: 64% -> 47%
- Overfitting (potential)
  - Data Set: Training -> Test
  - Performance: 93% -> 99%
- Balanced (Goldilocks zone)
- Data leakage -> Training Data overlap Test Data -> Overfitting
- Data mismatch -> Test Data is different to Training Data -> underfitting
- Fixes for underfitting
  - Try a more advanced model
  - Increase model hyperparameters
  - Reduce amount of features
  - Train longer
- Fixes for overfitting
  - Collect more data
  - Try a less advanced model
- Comparing models
  - Experiment 1: inputs -> model 1 -> outputs -> accurancy (87.5%) -> training time (3 min) -> prediction time (0.5 sec)
  - Experiment 2: inputs -> model 2 -> outputs -> accurancy (91.3%) -> training time (92 min) -> prediction time (1 sec)
  - Experiment 3: inputs -> model 3 -> outputs -> accurancy (94.7%) -> training time (176 min) -> prediction time (4 sec)
- Things to remember
  - Want to avoid overfitting and underfitting (head towards generality)
  - Keep the test set separate at all costs
  - Compare apples to apple
    - Model 1 on dataset 1
    - Model 2 on dataset 1
  - One best performance Metric does not equal the best model

# Standard deviation
# a measure of how spread out a group of numbers is from the mean
np.std(a2)

# measure of the average degree to which each number is different
# Higher variance = wider range of numbers
# Lower variance = lower range of numbers
np.var(a2)
np.sqrt(np.var(a2)) # Standard deviation = squareroot of variance

- What are we going to cover?
  - A Matplotlib workflow
    - Create data
    - Create plot (figure)
    - Plot data (axes on figure)
    - Customise plot
    - Save/share plot
  - Importing Matplotlib and the 2 ways of plotting Plotting data - from NumPy arrays

  # 1. Manipulate data

  # 2. Create plot

  # 3. Plot data

  # 4. Customize plot

  # 5. Save plot

  # 6. Return plot
  return plot
```

### [Importing And Using Matplotlib](sample-project/introduction-to-matplotlib.ipynb)

- Which one should you use? (pyplpt vs matplotlib OO method?)
  - When plotting something quickly, okay to use pyplot method
  - When plotting something more customized and advanced, use the OO method
- [Effectively Using Matplotlib](https://pbpython.com/effective-matplotlib.html)
- [Pyplot tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html)
- [The Lifecycle of a Plot](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/tutorials/introductory/lifecycle.html)

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Pyplot interface
# based on MATLAB and uses a state-based interface
plt.plot()
plt.plot(); #add ; to remove []
plt.plot()
plt.show()
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4]) # assume x = [0, 1, 2, 3]
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [11, 22, 33, 44]
plt.plot(x, y)

# Object-Oriented (OO) interface
# utilize an instance of axes.Axes in order to
# render visualizations on an instance of figure.Figure

# 1st method
fig = plt.figure() # creates a figure
ax = fig.add_subplot() # adds some axes
plt.show()

# 2nd method
fig = plt.figure() # creates a figure
ax = fig.add_axes([1, 1, 1, 1])
ax.plot(x, y) # add some data
plt.show()

# 3rd method (recommended)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y); # add some data
```

  - Improve a model
  - Save and load a trained model
  - Putting it all together!

```python
import numpy as np

# 1. Get the data ready
import pandas as pd
heart_disease = pd.read_csv("data/heart-disease.csv")

# Create X (features matrix) choose from age to thal
X = heart_disease.drop("target", axis=1)

# Create y (labels)
y = heart_disease["target"] # 0: no heart disease, 1: got heart disease

# 2. Choose the right model and hyperparameters
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

# We'll keep the default hyperparameters
model.get_params()

# 3. Fit the model to the training data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# test_size=0.2, 80% of data for training and 20% for testing
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Build a forest of trees from the training set (X, y)
model.fit(X_train, y_train);

# make a prediction
y_preds = model.predict(np.array(X_test))

# 4. Evaluate the model on the training data and test data

# Returns the mean accuracy on the given test data and labels
model.score(X_train, y_train)
model.score(X_test, y_test)

from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

print(classification_report(y_test, y_preds))

# Compute confusion matrix to evaluate the accuracy of a classification
confusion_matrix(y_test, y_preds)

# Accuracy classification score
accuracy_score(y_test, y_preds)

# 5. Improve a model
# Try different amount of n_estimators
np.random.seed(42)
for i in range(10, 100, 10):
    print(f"Trying model with {i} estimators...")
    clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=i).fit(X_train, y_train)
    print(f"Model accuracy on test set: {clf.score(X_test, y_test) * 100:.2f}%")
    print("")

# 6. Save a model and load it
import pickle # Python object serialization

pickle.dump(clf, open("random_forst_model_1.pkl", "wb")) # write binary

loaded_model = pickle.load(open("random_forst_model_1.pkl", "rb")) # read binary
loaded_model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Optional: Debugging Warnings In Jupyter

- [Updating packages](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-pkgs.html#updating-packages)

```python
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings("default")
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")

import sklearn
sklearn.show_versions()
```

- `conda list scikit-learn`
- `conda list python`
- `conda remove package`
- `conda install scikit-learn=0.22`

### [Getting Your Data Ready: Splitting Your Data](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Three main things we have to do:

- Split the data into features and labels (usually X & y)
  - Different names for X = features, features variables, data
  - Different names for y = labels, targets, target variables
- Converting non-numerical values to numerical values (also called feature encoding)
  - or one hot encoding
- Filling (also called imputing) or disregarding missing values

```python
# Split the data into features and labels (usually X & y)
X = heart_disease.drop("target", axis=1)
y = heart_disease["target"]

# Split the data into training and test sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
```

### Quick Tip: Clean, Transform, Reduce

Cannot assume all data you have is automatically going to be perfect

- Clean Data -> Transform data -> Reduce Data
- Clean Data: Remove a row or a column that's empty or has missing fields
- Clean Data: Calculate average to fill an empty cell
- Clean Data: Remove outliers in your data
- Transform data: Convert some of our information into numbers
- Transform data: Convert color into numbers
- Transform data is between zeros and ones
  - 0: No heart disease
  - 1: Heart disease
- Transform data: Data across the board uses the same units
- Reduce Data: More data more CPU
- Reduce Data: More energy it takes for us to run our computation
- Reduce Data: Same result on less data
- Reduce Data: Dimensionality reduction or column reduction
- Reduce Data: Remove irrelevant columns

### Getting Your Data Ready: [Convert Data To Numbers](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

```python
car_sales = pd.read_csv("data/car-sales-extended.csv")
car_sales.head()
# treat Doors as categorical
car_sales["Doors"].value_counts()
len(car_sales)
car_sales.dtypes

# Split into X/y
X = car_sales.drop("Price", axis=1)
y = car_sales["Price"]

# show one hot encoding
dummies = pd.get_dummies(car_sales[["Make", "Colour", "Doors"]])

# Turn the categories into numbers with one hot encoding
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Encode categorical integer features as a one-hot numeric array
categorical_features = ["Make", "Colour", "Doors"]
one_hot = OneHotEncoder()

# Applies transformers to columns of an array or pandas DataFrame
transformer = ColumnTransformer([("one_hot", one_hot, categorical_features)], remainder="passthrough")
transformed_X = transformer.fit_transform(X)
pd.DataFrame(transformed_X)
```

```python
car_sales_missing = pd.read_csv("data/car-sales-extended-missing-data.csv")
car_sales_missing.head()

# show number of column with missing value
car_sales_missing.isna().sum()

car_sales_missing["Doors"].value_counts()

# Fill the "Make" column
car_sales_missing["Make"].fillna("missing", inplace=True)

# Fill the "Colour" column
car_sales_missing["Colour"].fillna("missing", inplace=True)

# Fill the "Odometer (KM)" column. Filled with mean values
car_sales_missing["Odometer (KM)"].fillna(car_sales_missing["Odometer (KM)"].mean(), inplace=True)

# Fill the "Doors" column. Most cars have 4 doors
car_sales_missing["Doors"].fillna(4, inplace=True)

# Remove rows with missing Price value
car_sales_missing.dropna(inplace=True)

# show number of column with missing value
car_sales_missing.isna().sum()
len(car_sales_missing)

- Standardization: z = (x - u) / s
  - z: standard score of a sample x
  - x: sample x
  - u: mean of the training samples
  - s: standard deviation of the training samples
  - [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)
  - Feature scaling usually isn't required for your target variable
  - Feature scaling is usually not required with tree-based models (e.g. Random Forest) since they can handle varying features

### Getting Your Data Ready: [Handling Missing Values With Scikit-learn](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

The main takeaways:

- Split your data first (into train/test)
- Fill/transform the training set and test sets separately

```python
car_sales_missing = pd.read_csv("data/car-sales-extended-missing-data.csv")
car_sales_missing.head()
car_sales_missing.isna().sum()

# Drop the rows with no labels
car_sales_missing.dropna(subset=["Price"], inplace=True)

# Split into X & y
X = car_sales_missing.drop("Price", axis=1)
y = car_sales_missing["Price"]

# Split data into train and test
np.random.seed(42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fill missing values with Scikit-Learn
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

# Fill categorical values with 'missing' & numerical values with mean
cat_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing")
door_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value=4)
num_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")

# Define columns
cat_features = ["Make", "Colour"]
door_feature = ["Doors"]
num_features = ["Odometer (KM)"]

# Create an imputer (something that fills missing data)
imputer = ColumnTransformer([
    ("cat_imputer", cat_imputer, cat_features),
    ("door_imputer", door_imputer, door_feature),
    ("num_imputer", num_imputer, num_features)
])

# Fill train and test values separately
filled_X_train = imputer.fit_transform(X_train)
filled_X_test = imputer.transform(X_test)

# Get our transformed data array's back into DataFrame's
car_sales_filled_train = pd.DataFrame(filled_X_train,
                                      columns=["Make", "Colour", "Doors", "Odometer (KM)"])
car_sales_filled_test = pd.DataFrame(filled_X_test,
                                     columns=["Make", "Colour", "Doors", "Odometer (KM)"])

### [Evaluating A Classification Model (ROC Curve)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

[Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC/ROC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jRBRDbJemM)

- Area under curve (AUC)
- ROC curve

ROC curves are a comparison of a model's true postive rate (tpr) versus a models false positive rate (fpr).

- True positive = model predicts 1 when truth is 1
- False positive = model predicts 1 when truth is 0
- True negative = model predicts 0 when truth is 0
- False negative = model predicts 0 when truth is 1

```python
# Create X_test... etc
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

from sklearn.metrics import roc_curve

# Fit the classifier
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions with probabilities
y_probs = clf.predict_proba(X_test)
y_probs_positive = y_probs[:, 1]

# Calculate fpr, tpr and thresholds
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_probs_positive)
# Plot ROC curve
plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr)

from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score
# area under the curve, max area = 1
roc_auc_score(y_test, y_probs_positive)

# Plot perfect ROC curve and AUC score
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y_test, y_test)
plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr)

# Perfect AUC score
roc_auc_score(y_test, y_test)

```python
# Create a function for plotting ROC curves
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_roc_curve(fpr, tpr):
    """
    Plots a ROC curve given the false positive rate (fpr)
    and true positive rate (tpr) of a model.

### [Evaluating A Classification Model (Confusion Matrix)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

- A confusion matrix is a quick way to compare the labels a model predicts and the actual labels it was supposed to predict.
- In essence, giving you an idea of where the model is getting confused.

```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

y_preds = clf.predict(X_test)
confusion_matrix(y_test, y_preds)

# Visualize confusion matrix with pd.crosstab()
pd.crosstab(y_test, y_preds, rownames=["Actual Labels"], colnames=["Predicted Labels"])

# Make our confusion matrix more visual with Seaborn's heatmap()
import seaborn as sns

# Set the font scale
sns.set(font_scale=1.5)

# Create a confusion matrix
conf_mat = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_preds)

# Plot it using Seaborn
sns.heatmap(conf_mat);

plot_conf_mat(conf_mat)

from sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix
plot_confusion_matrix(clf, X, y);
```

```python
def plot_conf_mat(conf_mat):
  """
  Plots a confusion matrix using Seaborn's heatmap().
  """
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3,3))
  ax = sns.heatmap(conf_mat,
                    annot=True, # Annotate the boxes with conf_mat info
                    cbar=False)

### [Evaluating A Classification Model 6 (Classification Report)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Precision, Recall & F-Measure

- [Understanding Confusion Matrix](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-confusion-matrix-a9ad42dcfd62)
- [Precision, Recall & F-Measure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-EB6RqqjGI)
- [Performance measure on multiclass classification](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBi-P5j0Kec)
- Classification: Predict Category
- Determine if a sample shoe is Nike or not
- Confusion Matrix
  - True Positive (TP): Predict Nike shoe as Nike (Correct) Example: 0
  - False Positive (FP): Predict Non-Nike shoe as Nike (Wrong) Example: 0
  - False Negative (FN): Predict Nike shoe as Non-Nike (Wrong) Example: 10
  - True Negative (TN): Predict Non-Nike shoe as Non-Nike (Correct) Example: 9990
- Accuracy: % of correct prediction? (TP + TN) / total sample
  - Accuracy]() is a good measure to start with if all classes are balanced (e.g. same amount of samples which are labelled with 0 or 1).
- Precision and recall focus on TP, do not consider TN
- Precision: Of the shoes **classified** Nike, How many are **acutally** Nike?
  - Number of shoes **acutally** Nike = TP
  - Number of shoes **classified** Nike = TP + FP
  - Precision = TP / (TP + FP) = % of correct positive classification over total positive classification
  - When the model predicts a positive, how often is it correct?
- Recall: Of the shoes that are **actually** Nike, How many are **classified** as Nike?
  - Number of shoes **classified** Nike = TP
  - Number of shoes **acutally** Nike = TP + FN
  - Recall = TP / (TP + FN) = % of correct positive classification over total positive
  - When it is actually positive, how often does it predict a positive?
- Precision and recall become more important when classes are imbalanced.
  - If cost of false positive predictions are worse than false negatives, aim for higher precision.
    - For example, in spam detection, a false positive risks the receiver missing an important email due to it being incorrectly labelled as spam.
  - If cost of false negative predictions are worse than false positives, aim for higher recall.
    - For example, in cancer detection and terrorist detection the cost of a false negative prediction is likely to be deadly. Tell a cancer patient you have no cancer.
- F1-score is a combination of precision and recall.
  - Use F1 score if data is imbalanced

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report(y_test, y_preds))

# Where precision and recall become valuable
disease_true = np.zeros(10000)
disease_true[0] = 1 # only one positive case
disease_preds = np.zeros(10000) # model predicts every case as 0

pd.DataFrame(classification_report(disease_true,
                                   disease_preds,
                                   output_dict=True))

### [Evaluating A Regression Model 1 (R2 Score)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Regression model evaluation metrics

- R^2 (pronounced r-squared) or coefficient of determination.
- Mean absolute error (MAE)
- Mean squared error (MSE)

Which regression metric should you use?

- R2 is similar to accuracy. It gives you a quick indication of how well your model might be doing. Generally, the closer your R2 value is to 1.0, the better the model. But it doesn't really tell exactly how wrong your model is in terms of how far off each prediction is.
- MAE gives a better indication of how far off each of your model's predictions are on average.
- As for MAE or MSE, because of the way MSE is calculated, squaring the differences between predicted values and actual values, it amplifies larger differences. Let's say we're predicting the value of houses (which we are).
  - Pay more attention to MAE: When being $10,000 off is twice as bad as being $5,000 off.
  - Pay more attention to MSE: When being $10,000 off is more than twice as bad as being $5,000 off.

What R-squared does:

- Compares your models predictions to the mean of the targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1.
- For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, it's R^2 value would be 0.
- And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

np.random.seed(42)

X = boston_df.drop("target", axis=1)
y = boston_df["target"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train);
model.score(X_test, y_test)

from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

# Fill an array with y_test mean
y_test_mean = np.full(len(y_test), y_test.mean())

# Model only predicting the mean gets an R^2 score of 0
r2_score(y_test, y_test_mean)

# Model predicting perfectly the correct values gets an R^2 score of 1
r2_score(y_test, y_test)
```

### [Evaluating A Regression Model 2 (MAE)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Mean absolue error (MAE)

- MAE is the average of the aboslute differences between predictions and actual values. It gives you an idea of how wrong your models predictions are.

```python
# Mean absolute error
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

y_preds = model.predict(X_test)
mae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_preds)

df = pd.DataFrame(data={"actual values": y_test,
                        "predicted values": y_preds})
df["differences"] = df["predicted values"] - df["actual values"]
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### [Evaluating A Regression Model 3 (MSE)](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Mean squared error (MSE)

- MSE is the average of the square value of aboslute differences between predictions and actual values.

```python
# Mean squared error
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

y_preds = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_preds)

# Calculate MSE by hand
squared = np.square(df["differences"])
squared.mean()
```

### Machine Learning Model Evaluation

- Evaluating the results of a machine learning model is as important as building one.
- But just like how different problems have different machine learning models, different machine learning models have different evaluation metrics.
- Below are some of the most important evaluation metrics you'll want to look into for classification and regression models.

Classification Model Evaluation Metrics/Techniques

- Accuracy - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0.
- [Precision](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score) - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class 1) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.
- [Recall](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score) - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.
- [F1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.
- [Confusion matrix](https://www.dataschool.io/simple-guide-to-confusion-matrix-terminology/) - Compares the predicted values with the true values in a tabular way, if 100% correct, all values in the matrix will be top left to bottom right (diagonal line).
- [Cross-validation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) - Splits your dataset into multiple parts and train and tests your model on each part then evaluates performance as an average.
- [Classification report](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) - Sklearn has a built-in function called classification_report() which returns some of the main classification metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score.
- ROC Curve - Also known as receiver operating characteristic is a plot of true positive rate versus false-positive rate.
- [Area Under Curve (AUC) Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score.html) - The area underneath the ROC curve. A perfect model achieves an AUC score of 1.0.

Which classification metric should you use?

- Accuracy is a good measure to start with if all classes are balanced (e.g. same amount of samples which are labelled with 0 or 1).
- Precision and recall become more important when classes are imbalanced.
  - If false-positive predictions are worse than false-negatives, aim for higher precision.
  - If false-negative predictions are worse than false-positives, aim for higher recall.
- F1-score is a combination of precision and recall.
- A confusion matrix is always a good way to visualize how a classification model is going.

Regression Model Evaluation Metrics/Techniques

- [R^2 (pronounced r-squared)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html) or the coefficient of determination - Compares your model's predictions to the mean of the targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1. For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1.
- [Mean absolute error (MAE)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html) - The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. It gives you an idea of how wrong your predictions were.
- [Mean squared error (MSE)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_squared_error.html) - The average squared differences between predictions and actual values. Squaring the errors removes negative errors. It also amplifies outliers (samples which have larger errors).

Which regression metric should you use?

- R2 is similar to accuracy. It gives you a quick indication of how well your model might be doing. Generally, the closer your R2 value is to 1.0, the better the model. But it doesn't really tell exactly how wrong your model is in terms of how far off each prediction is.

### [Improving A Machine Learning Model](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

First predictions = baseline predictions. First model = baseline model.

From a data perspective:

- Could we collect more data? (generally, the more data, the better)
- Could we improve our data?

From a model perspective:

- Is there a better model we could use?
- Could we improve the current model?

Hyperparameters vs. Parameters

- Parameters = model find these patterns in data
- Hyperparameters = settings on a model you can adjust to (potentially) improve its ability to find patterns

Three ways to adjust hyperparameters:

- By hand
- Randomly with RandomSearchCV
- Exhaustively with GridSearchCV

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
clf.get_params()
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### [Tuning Hyperparameters by hand](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

- Let's make 3 sets, training, validation and test
- Training set (course materials): 70%
- Validation set (practice exam): 15%
- Test set (final exam): 15%

We're going to try and adjust:

- max_depth
- max_features
- min_samples_leaf
- min_samples_split
- n_estimators

```python

X_train, y_train = X[:train_split], y[:train_split] # training set
X_valid, y_valid = X[train_split:valid_split], y[train_split:valid_split] # validation set
X_test, y_test = X[valid_split:], y[valid_split:] # test set

### Quick Tip: Correlation Analysis

- [Intro to Feature Selection Methods for Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/intro-to-feature-selection-methods-for-data-science-4cae2178a00a)
- Correlation Analysis
  - a statistical method used to evaluate the strength of relationship between two quantitative variables
  - A high correlation means that two or more variables have a strong relationship with each other
  - A weak correlation means that the variables are hardly related
- Forward Attribute Selection
  - Forward selection is an iterative method in which we start with having no feature in the model. In each iteration, we keep adding the feature which best improves our model till an addition of a new variable does not improve the performance of the model.
- Backward Attribute Selection
  - In backward elimination, we start with all the features and removes the least significant feature at each iteration which improves the performance of the model. We repeat this until no improvement is observed on removal of features.

### [Saving And Loading A Model](sample-project/introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb)

Two ways to save and load machine learning models:

- With Python's [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) module
- With the [joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module

[Model persistence](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html)

```python
# pickle
# Save an extisting model to file
pickle.dump(gs_clf, open("gs_random_random_forest_model_1.pkl", "wb"))

# Load a saved model
loaded_pickle_model = pickle.load(open("gs_random_random_forest_model_1.pkl", "rb"))

# Make some predictions
pickle_y_preds = loaded_pickle_model.predict(X_test)
evaluate_preds(y_test, pickle_y_preds)

# Joblib
from joblib import dump, load

# Save model to file
dump(gs_clf, filename="gs_random_forest_model_1.joblib")

# Import a saved joblib model
loaded_joblib_model = load(filename="gs_random_forest_model_1.joblib")

# Make and evaluate joblib predictions
joblib_y_preds = loaded_joblib_model.predict(X_test)
evaluate_preds(y_test, joblib_y_preds)
```

### Putting It All Together

Things to remember

- All data should be numerical
- There should be no missing values
- Manipulate the test set the same as the training set
- Never test on data you’ve trained on
- Tune hyperparameters on validation set OR use cross-validation
- One best performance metric doesn’t mean the best model

[Pipeline](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html)

- chain multiple estimators into one
- chain a fixed sequence of steps in preprocessing and modelling

Steps we want to do (all in one cell):

- Fill missing data
- Convert data to numbers
- Build a model on the data

```python
data = pd.read_csv("data/car-sales-extended-missing-data.csv")
data.dtypes
data.isna().sum()

# Getting data ready
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# Modelling
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV

# Setup random seed
import numpy as np
np.random.seed(42)

# Import data and drop rows with missing labels
data = pd.read_csv("data/car-sales-extended-missing-data.csv")
data.dropna(subset=["Price"], inplace=True)

# Define different features and transformer pipeline
categorical_features = ["Make", "Colour"]
categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value="missing")),
    ("onehot", OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"))])

door_feature = ["Doors"]
door_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="constant", fill_value=4))
])

numeric_features = ["Odometer (KM)"]
numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ("imputer", SimpleImputer(strategy="mean"))
])

# Setup preprocessing steps (fill missing values, then convert to numbers)
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
                    transformers=[
                        ("cat", categorical_transformer, categorical_features),
                        ("door", door_transformer, door_feature),
                        ("num", numeric_transformer, numeric_features)
                    ])

# Creating a preprocessing and modelling pipeline
model = Pipeline(steps=[("preprocessor", preprocessor),
                        ("model", RandomForestRegressor())])

# Split data
X = data.drop("Price", axis=1)
y = data["Price"]
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Fit and score the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
model.score(X_test, y_test)

# Use GridSearchCV with our regression Pipeline
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

pipe_grid = {
    "preprocessor__num__imputer__strategy": ["mean", "median"],
    "model__n_estimators": [100, 1000],
    "model__max_depth": [None, 5],
    "model__max_features": ["auto"],
    "model__min_samples_split": [2, 4]
}

gs_model = GridSearchCV(model, pipe_grid, cv=5, verbose=2)
gs_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
gs_model.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### Step 1~4 Framework Setup

1. Problem Definition
   In a statement,

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

2. Data
   The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

3. Evaluation
   If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

4. Features
   This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data. You can do this via doing your own research (such as looking at the links above) or by talking to a subject matter expert (someone who knows about the dataset).

**Create data dictionary**

1. age - age in years
2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)
3. cp - chest pain type
   - 0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart
   - 1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart
   - 2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)
   - 3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease
4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern
5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
   - serum = LDL + HDL + .2 \* triglycerides
   - above 200 is cause for concern
6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
   - '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes
7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
   - 0: Nothing to note
   - 1: ST-T Wave abnormality
     - can range from mild symptoms to severe problems
     - signals non-normal heart beat
   - 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
     - Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber
8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest looks at stress of heart during excercise unhealthy heart will stress more
11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
    - 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)
    - 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)
    - 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart
12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
    - colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through
    - the more blood movement the better (no clots)
13. thal - thalium stress result
    - 1,3: normal
    - 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now
    - 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising
14. target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)

### [Exploring Our Data](heart-disease-project/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)

The goal here is to find out more about the data and become a subject matter export on the dataset you're working with.

- What question(s) are you trying to solve?
- What kind of data do we have and how do we treat different types?
- What's missing from the data and how do you deal with it?
- Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
- How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?

```python
df = pd.read_csv("data/heart-disease.csv")
df.shape # (rows, columns)

df.head()
df.tail()

# Let's find out how many of each class there
df["target"].value_counts()

df["target"].value_counts().plot(kind="bar", color=["salmon", "lightblue"]);

df.info()

# Are there any missing values?

### [Tuning Hyperparameters](heart-disease-project/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)

Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

We're going to tune: LogisticRegression()

```python
# Create a hyperparameter grid for LogisticRegression
log_reg_grid = {"C": np.logspace(-4, 4, 20),
                "solver": ["liblinear"]}
# Tune LogisticRegression

np.random.seed(42)

# Setup random hyperparameter search for LogisticRegression
rs_log_reg = RandomizedSearchCV(LogisticRegression(),
                                param_distributions=log_reg_grid,
                                cv=5,
                                n_iter=20,
                                verbose=True)

# Fit random hyperparameter search model for LogisticRegression
rs_log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

rs_log_reg.best_params_
rs_log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)
```

Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV

We're going to tune: RandomForestClassifier()

```python
# Create a hyperparameter grid for RandomForestClassifier
rf_grid = {"n_estimators": np.arange(10, 1000, 50),
           "max_depth": [None, 3, 5, 10],
           "min_samples_split": np.arange(2, 20, 2),
           "min_samples_leaf": np.arange(1, 20, 2)}

# Setup random seed

rs_rf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Find the best hyperparameters
rs_rf.best_params_

# Evaluate the randomized search RandomForestClassifier model
rs_rf.score(X_test, y_test)
```

Hyperparamter Tuning with GridSearchCV

Since our LogisticRegression model provides the best scores so far, we'll try and improve them again using GridSearchCV...

```python
# Different hyperparameters for our LogisticRegression model
log_reg_grid = {"C": np.logspace(-4, 4, 30),
                "solver": ["liblinear"]}

# Setup grid hyperparameter search for LogisticRegression
gs_log_reg = GridSearchCV(LogisticRegression(),
                          param_grid=log_reg_grid,
                          cv=5,
                          verbose=True)

# Fit grid hyperparameter search model
gs_log_reg.fit(X_train, y_train);

# Check the best hyperparmaters
gs_log_reg.best_params_

# Evaluate the grid search LogisticRegression model
gs_log_reg.score(X_test, y_test)
```

### [Finding The Most Important Features](heart-disease-project/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)

Feature importance is another as asking, "which features contributed most to the outcomes of the model and how did they contribute?"

Finding feature importance is different for each machine learning model. One way to find feature importance is to search for "(MODEL NAME) feature importance".

Let's find the feature importance for our LogisticRegression model...

```python
# Fit an instance of LogisticRegression
clf = LogisticRegression(C=0.20433597178569418,
                         solver="liblinear")

clf.fit(X_train, y_train);

# Check coef_
clf.coef_

# Match coef's of features to columns
feature_dict = dict(zip(df.columns, list(clf.coef_[0])))

# Visualize feature importance
feature_df = pd.DataFrame(feature_dict, index=[0])
feature_df.T.plot.bar(title="Feature Importance", legend=False);

pd.crosstab(df["sex"], df["target"])
pd.crosstab(df["slope"], df["target"])

### [Reviewing The Project](heart-disease-project/end-to-end-heart-disease-classification.ipynb)

If you haven't hit your evaluation metric yet... ask yourself...

- Could you collect more data?
- Could you try a better model? Like CatBoost or XGBoost?
- Could you improve the current models? (beyond what we've done so far)
- If your model is good enough (you have hit your evaluation metric) how would you export it and share it with others?

### Step 1~4 Framework Setup

🚜 Predicting the Sale Price of Bulldozers using Machine Learning

In this notebook, we're going to go through an example machine learning project with the goal of predicting the sale price of bulldozers.

1. Problem defition

> How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

2. Data

The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data

There are 3 main datasets:

- Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.
- Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.
- Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.

3. Evaluation

The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.

For more on the evaluation of this project check: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation

**Note:** The goal for most regression evaluation metrics is to minimize the error. For example, our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.

4. Features

Kaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset. You can view this data dictionary on Google Sheets: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ly-bLR8sbDJLITkWG7ozKm8l3RyieQ2Fpgix-beSYI/edit?usp=sharing

### [Exploring Our Data](bulldozer-price-prediction-project/end-to-end-bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import sklearn

# Import training and validation sets
df = pd.read_csv("data/TrainAndValid.csv",
                 low_memory=False)

df.info()
df.isna().sum()
df.columns

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(df["saledate"][:1000], df["SalePrice"][:1000])

df.saledate[:1000]
df.saledate.dtype
df.SalePrice.plot.hist()
```

Parsing dates

- When we work with time series data, we want to enrich the time & date component as much as possible.
- We can do that by telling pandas which of our columns has dates in it using the parse_dates parameter.

```python
# Import data again but this time parse dates
df = pd.read_csv("data/TrainAndValid.csv",
                 low_memory=False,
                 parse_dates=["saledate"])

df.saledate.dtype
df.saledate[:1000]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(df["saledate"][:1000], df["SalePrice"][:1000])

df.head()
df.head().T
df.saledate.head(20)

# Sort DataFrame in date order
df.sort_values(by=["saledate"], inplace=True, ascending=True)
df.saledate.head(20)

# Make a copy of the original DataFrame to perform edits on
df_tmp = df.copy()
```

df_tmp["saleDay"] = df_tmp.saledate.dt.day
df_tmp["saleDayOfWeek"] = df_tmp.saledate.dt.dayofweek
df_tmp["saleDayOfYear"] = df_tmp.saledate.dt.dayofyear

df_tmp.head().T
# Now we've enriched our DataFrame with date time features, we can remove 'saledate'
df_tmp.drop("saledate", axis=1, inplace=True)

# Check the values of different columns
df_tmp.state.value_counts()

### [Turning Data Into Numbers](bulldozer-price-prediction-project/end-to-end-bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb)

One way we can turn all of our data into numbers is by converting them into pandas catgories.

```python
df_tmp.info()
df_tmp["UsageBand"].dtype
df_tmp.head().T
pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(df_tmp["UsageBand"])

# Find the columns which contain strings
for label, content in df_tmp.items():
    if pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(content):
        print(label)

# This will turn all of the string value into category values
for label, content in df_tmp.items():
    if pd.api.types.is_string_dtype(content):
        df_tmp[label] = content.astype("category").cat.as_ordered()

df_tmp.info()
df_tmp.state.cat.categories
df_tmp.state.cat.codes

# Check missing data
df_tmp.isnull().sum()/len(df_tmp)

# Export current tmp dataframe
df_tmp.to_csv("data/train_tmp.csv",
              index=False)

# Import preprocessed data
df_tmp = pd.read_csv("data/train_tmp.csv",
                     low_memory=False)
df_tmp.head().T
df_tmp.isna().sum()
```

```python
# If you're wondering what df.items() does, here's an example
random_dict = {"key1": "hello",
               "key2": "world!"}

for key, value in random_dict.items():
    print(f"this is a key: {key}",
          f"this is a value: {value}")

            # Add a binary column which tells us if the data was missing or not
            df_tmp[label+"_is_missing"] = pd.isnull(content)
            # Fill missing numeric values with median
            df_tmp[label] = content.fillna(content.median())

# Check if there's any null numeric values
for label, content in df_tmp.items():
    if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(content):
        if pd.isnull(content).sum():
            print(label)

# Check to see how many examples were missing
df_tmp.auctioneerID_is_missing.value_counts()

df_tmp.isna().sum()

### [Challenge: What's wrong with splitting data after filling it?](bulldozer-price-prediction-project/end-to-end-bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb)

In the previous few videos we worked on filling the missing data in the training and validation data before splitting it into training and validation sets using the following code:

```python
# Split data into training and validation
df_val = df_tmp[df_tmp.saleYear == 2012]
df_train = df_tmp[df_tmp.saleYear != 2012]
```

The code worked but how might this interfere with our model?

Remember the goal of machine learning: use the past to predict the future.

So if our validation set is supposed to be representative of the future and we’re filling our training data using information from the validation set, what might this mean for our model?

The challenge here comes in two parts.

- What does it mean if we fill our training data with information from the future (validation set)?

- How might you implement a fix to the current way things are being done in the project?

If you need a hint, remember some takeaways from a previous lecture:

- Split your data first (into train/test), always keep your training & test data separate

- Fill/transform the training set and test sets separately (this goes for filling data with pandas as well)

- Don’t use data from the future (test set) to fill data from the past (training set)

Keep these things in mind when we create a data preprocessing function in a few videos time, they'll help you answer the question which gets raised then too.

    ax.set_xlabel("Feature importance")
    ax.invert_yaxis()

plot_features(X_train.columns, ideal_model.feature_importances_)

df["Enclosure"].value_counts()

**Final challenge/extension:** What other machine learning models could you try on our dataset?

**Hint:** https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html check out the regression section of this map, or try to look at something like CatBoost.ai or XGBooost.ai.

## **Section 13: Data Engineering**

### Data Engineering Introduction

Data science is all about using data to make business decisions

Data science is the idea of using data and converting it into something useful for a product or business.

Data analysis is a subset of data science that allows us to analyze the data that we have.

Machine Learning is a technique to allow a computer to learn and figure out the solution to a problem that may be a little too complicated for a human to solve or maybe too tedious and takes too long of a time so we want to automate it.

A company has all these datas are coming from their users from their security cameras from their Web site from IOT devices.

A data engineer takes all this information and then produces it and maintains it in databases or a certain type of computers so that the business has access to this data in an organized fashion.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### What Is Data?

- Part of Product - eg. YouTube recommendation engine
- Are we doing ok? - monitor the company's sales
- Can we do better?

Type of data (organised -> unorganised)

1. Structured Data - from relational Database
2. Semi-Structured Data - eg. XML, CSV, JSON
3. UnStructured Data - eg. pdf, email, document
4. Binary Data - audio, image, video

So one of the tasks of a data engineer is to essentially use the fact that there's all these types of data and somehow combine them or organize them in a way that is useful to the business.

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### What Is A Data Engineer?

Data Mining - pre processing and extracting some knowledge from the data

Big Data - data that's so big that you need to have it running on cloud computing or multiple computers

Data Pipeline - build a pipeline that allows us to flow from that unknown large amount of data to a pipeline that extracts data to a more useful form

A data engineer allows us to do this data collection part. They bring in all this information organize it in a way for us to do our data modelling.

And this is what a data engineer built a data engineer starts off with what we call data ingestion that

is acquiring data from various sources and we acquire all these different sources of data and ingested

into what we call a data lake a data lake is a collection.

Well all this data into one location from there we could just leave the lake as it is.

Build the following data pipeline

- Rain -> Data
- Collected into streams and rivers - data ingestion
  - acquire data from various sources and ingested into a data lake
- Lakes / Dam - Data lake (pool of raw data)
- filtration sanitary area - data transformation that is convert data from one format to another
  - data warehouse is a location for structured filtered data that has been processed and has a specific purpose
- plumbing and pipes for us to deliver water

Data Ingestion Tool

- Kafka

Data Lake Tools

- hadoop
- Azure Data lake
- Amazon S3

Data warehouse Tools

- Amazon Athena
- Amazon Redshift
- Google BigQuery

Who use Data Lake?

- Machine Learning
- Data Scientist

Who use Data Warehouse?

- Business intelligent
- business analyst
- data analyst

A software engineer, a software developer, app developer and mobile developer build programs and apps that users and customers use.

The app releases data. A data engineer would build this pipeline for us to ingest data and store it in different services like Hadoop like Google big query so that that data can be accessed by the rest of the business.

Next, data scientists use the data lake to extract information and deliver some sort of business value.

Finally we have data analysts or business intelligence to use something like a data warehouse or structured data to again derive business value.

3 main tasks of data engineer,

- Build ETL pipeline (Extract, Transform and Load into data warehouse)
- Build analysis tools
- Maintain data warehouse and data lakes

## **Section 14: Neural Networks: Deep Learning, Transfer Learning and TensorFlow 2**

### Deep Learning and Unstructured Data

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)

- alternative to jupyter notebook

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### Using A GPU

[Tensorflow with GPU](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb)

But we can fix this going to runtime and then changing the runtime type:

- Go to Runtime.
- Click "Change runtime type".
- Where it says "Hardware accelerator", choose "GPU" (don't worry about TPU for now but feel free to research them).
- Click save.
- The runtime will be restarted to activate the new hardware, so you'll have to rerun the above cells.
  - If the steps have worked you should see a print out saying "GPU available".

### [Creating Our Own Validation Set](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OZLn22hAZkNY1hHaK-FePk8sLVnbTBwV#scrollTo=d4DgYi9Zceiy)

[How (and why) to create a good validation set](https://www.fast.ai/2017/11/13/validation-sets/)

```python
# Setup X & y variables
X = filenames
y = boolean_labels

len(filenames)

# Set number of images to use for experimenting
NUM_IMAGES = 1000 #@param {type:"slider", min:1000, max:10000, step:1000}

# Let's split our data into train and validation sets
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split them into training and validation of total size NUM_IMAGES
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X[:NUM_IMAGES],
                                                  y[:NUM_IMAGES],
                                                  test_size=0.2,
                                                  random_state=42)

len(X_train), len(y_train), len(X_val), len(y_val)

# Check out the training data (image file paths and labels)
X_train[:5], y_train[:2]
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### [Preprocess Images](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OZLn22hAZkNY1hHaK-FePk8sLVnbTBwV#scrollTo=d4DgYi9Zceiy)

- tensors are numerical representation
- like a matrix
- [Load images](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images)
- [tf.data: Build TensorFlow input pipelines](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/data)

```python
# Convert image to NumPy array
from matplotlib.pyplot import imread
image = imread(filenames[42])
image.shape # color channel
# dimensions: 350 x 257
# each pixel has 3 part (rgb)

image.max(), image.min()
image[:2]

# turn image into a tensor
tf.constant(image)[:2]
```

Now we've seen what an image looks like as a Tensor, let's make a function to preprocess them.

We'll create a function to:

1. Take an image filepath as input
2. Use TensorFlow to read the file and save it to a variable, `image`
3. Turn our `image` (a jpg) into Tensors
4. Normalize our image (convert color channel values from from 0-255 to 0-1).
5. Resize the `image` to be a shape of (224, 224)
6. Return the modified `image`

```python
# Define image size
IMG_SIZE = 224

# Create a function for preprocessing images
def process_image(image_path, img_size=IMG_SIZE):
  """
  Takes an image file path and turns the image into a Tensor.
  """
  # Read in an image file
  image = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
  # Turn the jpeg image into numerical Tensor with 3 colour channels (Red, Green, Blue)
  image = tf.image.decode_jpeg(image, channels=3)
  # Convert the colour channel values from 0-255 to 0-1 values
  image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, tf.float32)
  # Resize the image to our desired value (224, 224)
  image = tf.image.resize(image, size=[IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE])

  return image
```

### [Preparing Our Inputs and Outputs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OZLn22hAZkNY1hHaK-FePk8sLVnbTBwV#scrollTo=d4DgYi9Zceiy)

Building a model

Before we build a model, there are a few things we need to define:

- The input shape (our images shape, in the form of Tensors) to our model.
- The output shape (image labels, in the form of Tensors) of our model.
- The URL of the model we want to use from TensorFlow Hub https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4

```python
IMG_SIZE

# Setup input shape to the model
INPUT_SHAPE = [None, IMG_SIZE, IMG_SIZE, 3] # batch, height, width, colour channels

# Setup output shape of our model
OUTPUT_SHAPE = len(unique_breeds)

# Setup model URL from TensorFlow Hub
MODEL_URL = "https://tfhub.dev/google/imagenet/mobilenet_v2_130_224/classification/4"

INPUT_SHAPE
```

### How machines learn and what's going on behind the scenes?

Massive effort getting the data ready for use with a machine learning model! This is one of the most important steps in any machine learning project.

Now you've got the data ready, you're about to dive headfirst into writing deep learning code with TensorFlow 2.x.

Since we're focused on writing code first and foremost, these videos are optional but they're here for those who want to start to get an understanding of what goes on behind the scenes.

How Machines Learn

The first is a video called [How Machines Learn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo) by GCP Grey on YouTube.

It's a non-technical narrative explaining how some of the biggest tech companies in the world use data to improve their businesses. In short, they're leveraging techniques like the ones you've been learning. Instead of trying to think of every possible rule to code, they collect data and then use machines to figure out the patterns for them.

What actually is a neural network?

You're going to be writing code which builds a neural network (a type of machine learning model) so you might start to wonder, what's going on when you run the code?

When you pass inputs (often data and labels) to a neural network and it figures out patterns between them, how is it doing so?

When it tries to make predictions and gets them wrong, how does it improve itself?

[The deep learning series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk) by 3Blue1Brown on YouTube contains a technical deep-dive into what's going on behind the code you're writing.

Be warned though, it isn't for the faint of heart. The videos explain the topics in a beautiful way but it doesn't mean the topics aren't still difficult to comprehend.

If you're up for it, a good idea would be to watch 1 video in the series one day and then another the day after and so on.

Remember, you don't need to know all of these things to get started writing machine learning code. Focus on solving problems first (like we're doing in this project) and then dive deeper when you need to.

And since these videos are optional, feel free to bookmark them for now, continue with the course and come back later!

### [Evaluating Our Model](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OZLn22hAZkNY1hHaK-FePk8sLVnbTBwV#scrollTo=LrjvXtrpszqp)

Callbacks are helper functions a model can use during training to do such things as save its progress, check its progress or stop training early if a model stops improving.

To setup a TensorBoard callback, we need to do 3 things:
- Load the TensorBoard notebook extension ✅
- Create a TensorBoard callback which is able to save logs to a directory and pass it to our model's `fit()` function. ✅
- Visualize our models training logs with the `%tensorboard` magic function (we'll do this after model training).
 
```python
# Load TensorBoard notebook extension
%load_ext tensorboard

import datetime

# Create a function to build a TensorBoard callback
# to help track our models progress

def create_tensorboard_callback():
  # Create a log directory for storing TensorBoard logs
  logdir = os.path.join("drive/My Drive/Dog Vision/logs",
                        # Make it so the logs get tracked whenever we run an experiment
                        datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))
  return tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard(logdir)
```

Our first model is only going to train on 1000 images, to make sure everything is working.

```python

# Build a function to train and return a trained model
def train_model():
  """
  Trains a given model and returns the trained version.
  """
  # Create a model
  model = create_model()

  # Create new TensorBoard session everytime we train a model
  tensorboard = create_tensorboard_callback()

  # Fit the model to the data passing it the callbacks we created
  model.fit(x=train_data,
            epochs=NUM_EPOCHS,
            validation_data=val_data,
            validation_freq=1,
            callbacks=[tensorboard, early_stopping])
  # Return the fitted model
  return model

# Fit the model to the data

### [Visualizing Model Predictions](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OZLn22hAZkNY1hHaK-FePk8sLVnbTBwV#scrollTo=LrjvXtrpszqp)

We'll create a function which:

- Takes an array of prediction probabilities, an array of truth labels and an array of images and an integer. ✅
- Convert the prediction probabilities to a predicted label. ✅
- Plot the predicted label, its predicted probability, the truth label and the target image on a single plot. ✅

```python
def plot_pred(prediction_probabilities, labels, images, n=1):
  """
  View the prediction, ground truth and image for sample n
  """
  pred_prob, true_label, image = prediction_probabilities[n], labels[n], images[n]

  # Get the pred label
  pred_label = get_pred_label(pred_prob)

  # Plot image & remove ticks
  plt.imshow(image)
  plt.xticks([])
  plt.yticks([])

  # Change the colour of the title depending on if the prediction is right or wrong
  if pred_label == true_label:
    color = "green"
  else:
    color = "red"
  
  # Change plot title to be predicted, probability of prediction and truth label
  plt.title("{} {:2.0f}% {}".format(pred_label,
                                    np.max(pred_prob)*100,
                                    true_label),
                                    color=color)

plot_pred(prediction_probabilities=predictions,
          labels=val_labels,
          images=val_images,
          n=0)
```

Now we've got one function to visualize our models top prediction, let's make another to view our models top 10 predictions.

```python
def plot_pred_conf(prediction_probabilities, labels, n=1):
  """
  Plus the top 10 highest prediction confidences along with the truth label for sample n.
  """
  pred_prob, true_label = prediction_probabilities[n], labels[n]

  # Get the predicted label
  pred_label = get_pred_label(pred_prob)

  # Find the top 10 prediction confidence indexes
  top_10_pred_indexes = pred_prob.argsort()[-10:][::-1]
  # Find the top 10 prediction confidence values
  top_10_pred_values = pred_prob[top_10_pred_indexes]
  # Find the top 10 prediction labels
  top_10_pred_labels = unique_breeds[top_10_pred_indexes]

  # Setup plot
  top_plot = plt.bar(np.arange(len(top_10_pred_labels)),
                     top_10_pred_values,
                     color="grey")
  plt.xticks(np.arange(len(top_10_pred_labels)),
             labels=top_10_pred_labels,
             rotation="vertical")
  
  # Change color of true label
  if np.isin(true_label, top_10_pred_labels):
    top_plot[np.argmax(top_10_pred_labels == true_label)].set_color("green")
  else:
    pass

plot_pred_conf(prediction_probabilities=predictions,
               labels=val_labels,
               n=9)
```

Now we've got some function to help us visualize our predictions and evaluate our modle, let's check out a few.

```python
# Let's check out a few predictions and their different values
i_multiplier = 20
num_rows = 3
num_cols = 2
num_images = num_rows*num_cols
plt.figure(figsize=(10*num_cols, 5*num_rows))
for i in range(num_images):
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+1)
  plot_pred(prediction_probabilities=predictions,
            labels=val_labels,
            images=val_images,
            n=i+i_multiplier)
  plt.subplot(num_rows, 2*num_cols, 2*i+2)
  plot_pred_conf(prediction_probabilities=predictions,
                 labels=val_labels,
                 n=i+i_multiplier)

Now you’ve got skills, what do you do next?
The most important question you can ask

- “Who’s it for?”
- What questions will they have?
- What concerns can you address before they arise?
- Heard but not understood
- Heard and (potentially) understood

“Who’s it for?”

### Communicating With Managers

“Who’s it for?”
“What do they need to know?”

- How the project is going
- What’s in the way
- What you’ve done
- What you’re doing next
- Why you’re doing something next
- Who else could help
- What’s not needed Where you’re stuck
- What’s not clear What questions do have
- Are you still working towards the right thing
- Is there any feedback or advice

Example: The Project Manager, Boss, Senior, Lead

The People You’re Working With, Sitting Next to, in the Group Chat

Break it down

- 6-month project
- 4-week month
- 5-day week

What did you work on today?

- What I worked on today (1-3 points on what you did):
  - What’s working?
  - What’s not working?
  - What could be improved?
- What I’m working on next:

  - What’s your next course of action? (based on the above)
  - Why?
  - What’s holding you back?

- Relate back to overall project goal
- Take note of overlaps

### Weekend Project Principle

Start the job before you have it
The weekend project principle

- What you work on in your own time
- Work on your own projects to build specific knowledge
- Compound knowledge that you learn courses into skill which can't be taught in courses

How?

- Documented on your blog
- 6-week project

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Communicating With Outside World

People outside your team: Clients, Customers and Fans

- Obvious to you, amazing to others

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Storytelling

What story are you trying to tell?
Always ask, Who’s it for?

- “Who’s it for?”
- “What do they need to know?” = Specific = Courage
  Write it down
- What did you work on today?
- What are you working this week?
  Progress, not perfection
- “Here’s what I’ve done.”
